# Alien-Dodger-HTML5-Phaser-Game
The Alien Dodger project showcases my skills in frontend game development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with game logic and real-time animation implemented through Phaser 3 and rendering capabilities extended using PixiJS. I designed a responsive arcade-style game featuring sprite-based enemy movement, collision detection, keyboard controls, and dynamic score tracking, all styled with a modern UI and organized through external JSON configuration for scalability. This project demonstrates my ability to build engaging, browser-compatible games with smooth animations, interactive elements, and performance-conscious design principles suitable for both desktop and mobile environments.
